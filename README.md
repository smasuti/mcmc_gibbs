# mcmc_gibbs
MCMC simulation using Gibbs sampling.

This is the simple Gibbs sampling algorithm. The file gibbs_sample.m contains the
function and an example is given in the example.m file on how to use. The example
uses a simple forward model of the form dobs=m1*(1-exp(-m2*x)).

After running the example you will see the posterior plotted something like below.

Feel free to use this code as you like. You may or may not acknowledge me and thats
perfectly fine.
